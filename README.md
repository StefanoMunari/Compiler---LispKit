# The Lispkit Compiler

Compiler and interpreter for the minimal programming language Lispkit.
Implemented for the course of
*Programming Languages AA 2015/2016 (Univeristy of Padua)*.

## Components

### Lexical Analyzer - Lexer

Given a program P as input it generates the related token sequence T.

### Syntactic Analyzer - Parser
* *syntax.hs* - verifies the syntax correctness (regarding the lispkit language)
of the token list generated by lexi 
(see lexer.hs): it outputs "REACHED" if everything is correct, otherwise it 
outputs "ERROR". The parsed tokens are wrapped inside a monad Exc, the 
purpose of this monad is to handle exceptions in a declarative manner thus
preserving the pure functional nature of Haskell;
* *parser.hs* - builds the parse tree for the grammar G. it translates
the token list into a LKC tree adding synthetized and inherited attributes
while constructs the parse tree.

#### Grammar

G is a [context-free grammar (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). 
The chosen CFG is an LL(1) grammar: the input is 
parsed from left to right applying leftmost derivations on non-terminal elements
and considering only one symbol at time. It considers the input only once without 
backtracking. Initially the given grammar was an ambiguos grammar (see docs/grammar/g0_\*.pdf),
it has been corrected into the described grammar (see docs/grammar/g1_\*.pdf)

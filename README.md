# The Lispkit Compiler

Compiler and interpreter for the minimal programming language Lispkit.
The compiler has been implemented for the course of
*Programming Languages* AA 2015/2016 (Univeristy of Padua).

## Components

### Lexical Analyzer - Lexer

Given a program P as input it generates the related token sequence T.

### Syntactic Analyzer - Parser

Builds the parse tree for the grammar G. It takes the string of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer as input

#### Grammar

G is a [context-free grammar (CFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar), 
essentialy it describes the syntax of the language and the transitions between automata state. The chosen CFG is  
a LL(1) grammar: it means that the input is parsed from left to right considering only one time all the string, it parses the input one symbol at time
